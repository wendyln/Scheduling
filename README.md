# Scheduling
Developed a large-scale integer programming system to generate the official college final exam schedule (52K exams), minimizing conflicts, back-to-back exams, and other operational constraints. Achieved a 10× improvement in computational efficiency through hot-start strategies and cloud-based parallelization on Google Cloud, producing a portfolio of candidate schedules for decision support.

Built Gradient Boosted Tree and Logistic Regression models to forecast course enrollment and enhance constraint modeling. Additionally explored attention-based models to predict future enrollments, enabling pre-generation of potential exam schedules.

This repository contains a simplified sample of the codebase with baseline implementations for demonstration purposes.
